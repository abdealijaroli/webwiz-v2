# WebWiz V2

This is a successor to my first ever AI-powered web designing project - [WebWiz](https://github.com/abdealijaroli/webwiz). It was built way before the existence of [v0.dev]() and [bolt.new](). It was built when OpenAI first released their API and I thought, "What if I built something like text-to-website?" WebWiz was born. Now I am back with a superior and more powerful successor, the V2.
